# Overlay mod X (KoiSkinOverlayX / KSOX)
Koikatu! mod that allows adding overlay textures (also called tattoos) to character's face and body. These additional textures are saved inside the card and used by the main game and studio.

This mod is based on the original KoiSkinOverlay mod by essu and adds saving to cards, GUI and some other new features.
